# Methodology

'''
    For the optimization of One Diode PV Model, this code uses TLBO (Teaching Learning based Optimisation) Approach.
    The TLBO Algorithm was proposed by R.V. Rao et. al. in the article 'Teachingâ€“learning-based optimization: a novel method for constrained mechanical design optimization problems'.
    The link to the scientific paper - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448510002484

    For optimising the One Diode Model's equation to get the MPP (Maximum Power Point) we need to find Power (P) in terms of I (Current) and V (Voltage). 
    The formulas and definitions written at the start of this program will be considered for this code.
    In this approach I have created randomized population of `two` dimension as I and V are the two variables.
    As the code is written to find the `minima` for any function, I have multiplied all the Power values generated from One Diode model with `-1`.
    Detailed information about TLBO and it's working can be found in the above-mentioned paper.
